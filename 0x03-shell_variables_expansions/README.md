# Shell Expansions
Apparently there is an easier way to do Caeser's cipher. I can't believe cs50 made me suffer that much on C.

## Why CS50 made me suffer?
I guess they will say they just wanted to teach the stuff with therir sentimental somethings.

### MOst Probably
It is most probable that even ALX will give us some Caeser cipher to solve in the near future. It feels like hey ind of copied CS50 but made their couse include a whole lot more stuff in a short time.
